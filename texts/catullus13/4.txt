You will dine well with me, my Fabullus, in a few days,
if the gods favor you, if you bring with you a good and large dinner,
not without a dazzling girl and wine and wit and all your loud laughter.
If you bring these things, I say, our charming one, 
you will eat well; for the wallet of your Catullus is full of cobwebs.
But in return, you receive pure loves of anything that is more sweet or elegant:
for I will give you perfume, which the Venuses and Cupids gave to my girl,
which, when you smell it, you will ask the gods,
Fabullus, to make all of you a nose.
