Literal English translation (Wikipedia). <br> 

You will dine well, my Fabullus, at my house
in a few days, if the gods favor you,
if with you you bring a good and great
meal, not without a fair-skinned girl
both wine and wit and all the banter.
If you bring these, I say, our charming friend,
you will dine well, for the purse of your Catullus
is full of cobwebs.
But in exchange you will receive most pure friendship
or if anything is more sweet or more elegant:
for I will give perfume, which to my girl
Venus and Cupids have given,
which when you will smell it, you will ask the gods,
to make you, Fabullus, all nose.
