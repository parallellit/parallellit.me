Literal English translation (Wikisource). <br>

You ask, my Lesbia, how many of your kisses
are enough and more than enough for me.
As big a number as the Libyan sand-grains
that lay at asafoetida-bearing Cyrene
between the oracle of sultry Jupiter
and the sacred tomb of old Battus;
or as many stars, when the night is quiet,
see the secret loves of men.
So many kisses for mad Catullus to kiss you
are enough and more than enough, [kisses]
which neither the curious can count
nor an evil tongue bewitch.
