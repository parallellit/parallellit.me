			<h3>About ParalelLit</h3>
			<hr />
			<p>Every translation is an interpretation. A translation “is not the transfer of a text from one language to another. It is a transformation of a text into another” (Kristal 32). Every time a translator chooses one word over another or changes a sentence’s structure in order to fit the new language, she makes an interpretive decision. Each of these decisions can–and likely will–be made differently by a different translator. Therefore, it is impossible, when translating a work of literature, to remain faithful to every aspect of the original. In fact, some have argued that remaining faithful to every aspect of the original language would inhibit the larger goals of the work. “Words taken one by one obscure the force and meaning of a text, which is why a word-for-word translation is almost never a good job. This isn’t a new argument: arguments against literal translation go back almost as far as written translation itself” (Bellos 102). So a translator is forced to choose between staying faithful to the content–the meaning of the words chosen–and the style–the sounds and structures of those words. This is most drastically observed in the case of rhyming poetry, as rhyme is almost never directly translatable, but it happens to some degree in every act of translation. </p>
<p>Unlike translations for medicine or law, where the sole aim is accuracy, in literature there is no standard measure of a good translation. “There is no...collective agreement about where the ‘top model’ lies. Should a new foreign novel in translation conform to the manner and style of some existing writer of English prose? Some would say, Of course not!...Others would say, Of course it should!...There is no resolution to this squabble” (Bellos 299). However, there are different things to be gained from these different approaches to translation.</p>
<p>When reading a translation, then, it’s hard to know what the translator’s intent was, which aspects of the original text she chose to emphasize. It’s even harder to know which aspects the translator left out. For this reason, it’s almost impossible to get an accurate sense of the original text by reading it in translation. However, you can get close: since each translation makes different interpretive decisions, taking into account many translations together will show you many possible interpretive decisions. Considering many different interpretations in this way can help you better understand the original text. It also allows you in some sense to construct a more accurate picture of the original. </p>
<p>“Borges was certain that...one of the most fertile of all literary experiences is a comparative survey of the versions of a work” (Kristal 2). Many translations are often difficult to find, and it’s hard to read a printed work side-by-side with digital translations or other resources. A digital tool like ParallelLit makes the comparison of multiple translations much easier, facilitating this “comparative survey.” Obvious uses for this tool lie in literature and translation studies to augment a scholar’s understand of a text. It can also be helpful in language classes, to aid students both in reading and in writing translations. This is an important consideration because “translation is frequently taught as if it had been written in English, and students are not made familiar with the cultural, linguistic, and literary context in which that literature was produced...they submit what they read to their own cultural expectations; they do not read in translation and do not reap the benefits of intercultural communication” (Maier). It is common for even literary critics to forget that a work has been translated, and this narrow view allows only for a partial reading of any text. </p>
		<p>By offering several translations of a literary work in parallel, ParallelLit allows you to access all these interpretations at once, so that you can better understand the original.

ParallelLit contains multiple translations for each text within its database and allows you to compare them side by side. Translations can be uploaded and compiled to help you better understand certain words, sentences, and selected passages.</p>
